        chat_input: why carbon is important?
      outputs:
        chat_output: Carbon is important for several reasons. It is essential to life on Earth as it is the basis of organic chemistry and the building block for all living things. It is also a significant component of the Earth's atmosphere, where it plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's temperature through the carbon cycle. However, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing an imbalance in the carbon cycle, leading to an increase of carbon in the atmosphere and contributing to global climate change.
